# Ethernaut

[Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com) is a Web3/Solidity based wargame inspired by [overthewire.org](https://overthewire.org/wargames/), played in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Each level is a smart contract that needs to be 'hacked'. The game is 100% open source and all levels are contributions made by other players.
